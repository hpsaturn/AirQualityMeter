Comparative studies about CO2 sensors and experiences
=====================================================

From "Demand Controlled Ventilation and Classroom Ventilation" study:
"Many of the new CO2 sensors had errors greater than 75 ppm, and errors greater than 200 ppm were not unusual.  Maximum errors of new sensors approached 500 ppm."

From "Algorithm evaluation for e(CO2)-tracking (AEFECT)" study during calibration sensors stage:
"The largest leaps were found in the signal of CM1106 integrated in MSS 1. They occurred at October 17th, 2017 at 00:06am (575 vol.-ppm upward in the raw signal) and at November 16 th, 2019 3:09pm (503 vol.-ppm downward in the raw signal), when no one was in the laboratory."
